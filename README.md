This is a Symptoms Based Disease Prediction Website

The following algorithms are used in developing the Symptoms Based Disease Prediction Model:-                                                                                                                                           
(1)Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

(2)Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

(3)The k-nearest neighbors’ algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

(4)Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems. It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset. Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.

Users can give input their various symptoms and the issues they are facing. The application then takes the user's symptoms as inputs to check for various illnesses that could be associated with it using the algorithms. The system also provides the users with suggestions for doctors in their region whom they can consult for treatment of their predicted illness. 


The project includes a Symptoms Based Disease Predicting website which allows user to give input symptoms and predicts the disease based on the input. The pages included are-
 	Home Page-
The Home Page contains buttons to 

 	Symptoms Input Page- 
The Symptoms Input Page takes input form the users.
The input are the symptoms that the user feels. 
And predicts the disease according to the input of symptoms. 

 	GPS Page-
The GPS page provides the location of the nearest hospital.

 	About Page-
The About Page provides list of diseases that can be predicted on the website. 

 	Feedback Page-
The Feedback Page takes users message as feedback and saves the feedback in the database.

All the pages are developed with the help of html, JavaScript and CSS. In CSS the pages are styled and in JavaScript the functions added and both CSS and JavaScript are connected together with the help of html. The backend is connected to the frontend using FLASK.
